##How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing the software by identifying the goals of the project firsts and what it is trying to do. New disign skills that helped me were learnging how to create balance and realism in a 3D scene using different shapes, textures, and lighting techniques. The design process I followed was first figuring out what shapes were needed to create the modern living room. I also learned to design modular code for scene elements so that each part of the environment could be updated or reused more easily. My tactics could be applied in the future by starting with a clear concept, planning ahead, and using iterative refinement. This can be applied to any future project, whether it involves graphics, front end design, or even system architecture. 

##How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I approach developing programs by structure and readability. I build the foundation first and then layer in functionality. Development strategies I used were resuable functions to handle common tasks like tectures and lighting. Iteration was a big part because I would add a feature, test it, see how it looked or behaved in the scene, and then revise it. As I moved along in the course I became more focused on modularity, reuse, and user experience. I also got more comfortable using shaders, managing transformations, and integrating lighting models. 

##How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer Science can help me by reaching my goals by giving me the tools to solve problems and build systems that bring ideas to life. It gives me the knowledge and skills for education by introducing me to the mathematical and technical side of visual design, which will be useful in courses involving simulations, game development, and UI/UX design. it can also help me professonally by knowing how to work with 3D graphics and visualizations opens up opportunities in fields like virtual reality, product design, architecture, game development, and data visualization.
